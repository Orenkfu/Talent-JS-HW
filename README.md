# Talent-JS-HW

Homework for JS async programming. Pure JS version and Angular version.

## Angular version

clone the repo, open angular folder with vs code, and run the npm command "npm install" to install dependencies.
then deploy webpack with "ng serve".

### Features
```
Angular project is a bit different from HW requirements, though it is connected to the API specified.

```
```
Using Bootstrap and ng router module, you can navigate between different components,
where you can browse a table containing data obtained from API.
```
```
Using a reusable pagination component, you can view the different pages of "users" provided by API.
```

## JS version

clone, and open html file in browser.

### Features

A simple get application showcasing the use of JS Promise (and the flaws of using it badly, I guess)

```
Select a page from the select dropdown.
```

```
Click the "Get" button to send a Get request to the server, with the page selected in the previous step.
```
```
View table of clients received from API.
```
```
View "avatar"(image) of first member of the user array received from API.
```
